Review of Uses about GitHub Repositories


Dear all, this time I am going to tell you about the use of public repositories on github. I have usually used some public repositories in order to be able to reuse the code used and shared by the github community in some data science projects such as classification models, forecasting and some machine learning engineer deployments that I have developed in my professional experience. Also, regarding the use of github, I consider it a very important tool to maintain order in the code, maintenance can be done and knowledge can be shared within an organization or community.
